# CODENAME-WARS
Warfare ASCII Replication Simulator, aka WARS, is a political/warfare/country simulation game. I'll try to build it to be silky smooth to mod, but no promises.
Written in Python, using Curses as a main library, but because I'm a little windows freak, I used this (https://pypi.org/project/windows-curses/#description) instead of the "real" thing.
